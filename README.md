## Description

This is a very very basic C# console app. Its mostly to prove the understanding of the file structure and inheritance of methods and properties. I based this off of animals and built on my Cow and Chicken mostly. I made sure that the cow wrote responses and returned things via the console. If you look in the app most of the things come from base animal and it is then over ridden in Cow and Chicken.
